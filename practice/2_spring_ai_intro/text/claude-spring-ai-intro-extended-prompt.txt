# How to ensure Always Works™ implementation
Please ensure your implementation Always Works™ for: $ARGUMENTS.
Follow this systematic approach:
## Core Philosophy
- "Should work" ≠ "does work" - Pattern matching isn't enough
- I'm not paid to write code, I'm paid to solve problems
- Untested code is just a guess, not a solution
# The 30-Second Reality Check - Must answer YES to ALL:
- Did I run/build the code?
- Did I trigger the exact feature I changed?
- Did I see the expected result with my own observation (including GUI)?
- Did I check for error messages?
- Would I bet $100 this works?
# Phrases to Avoid:
- "This should work now"
- "I've fixed the issue" (especially 2nd+ time)
- "Try it now" (without trying it myself)
- "The logic is correct so..."
# Specific Test Requirements:
- UI Changes: Actually click the button/link/form
- API Changes: Make the actual API call
- Data Changes: Query the database
- Logic Changes: Run the specific scenario
- Config Changes: Restart and verify it loads
# The Embarrassment Test:
"If the user records trying this and it fails, will I feel embarrassed to see his face?"
# Time Reality:
- Time saved skipping tests: 30 seconds
- Time wasted when it doesn't work: 30 minutes
- User trust lost: Immeasurable
A user describing a bug for the third time isn't thinking "this AI is trying hard" - they're thinking "why am I wasting time with this incompetent tool?"

user request: Structure a series of presentation slides for Spring AI.
The slides must explain the fundamental concepts of the Spring project, with advantages and disadvantages.
The slides are aimed at Java programmers with experience in Spring Boot.
The slides must be structured in LaTeX language, following the template file "ai.tex" provided.
When you insert Java code using the minted package, use the format and template explained in the "minted-extract.pdf" provided.
Once you finish, translate all textual content in the slides in Italian language.
